# 🤖 RoboVisionSmith 
Robotics Vision Research project developed under Prof. Joseph Vybihal at McGill Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Research Laboratory. Focused on non-neural robotic vision for classifying environments on Research Lab’s NavigBot-Compact (IMX477 12MP) and TerrainScout-Micro (OV9281 global shutter) platforms, optimized for resource-constrained embedded systems.
